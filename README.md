Python Task

Write a program that would mimic the operations of an ATM machine.
1. Your application should have information of multiple users stored in a dictionary as listed below.
 
    {'username':'trial', 'pin':0000, 'balance':{'GHS':140, 'USD':0}
 
2. Provide an option to login.
 
3. The application should have two operations that run fully after a user is logged in.
    a. Withdraw Money and update balance for user after the withdrawal.
    b. Check balance of the user
    c. Give the user the opportunity to withdraw money again or to quit
    d. Ask the user if they want a receipt or not for their transaction and generate a simple print statement as a receipt
 
4. Go ahead and add any additional features you would want to add as well, make the program intuitive also(The user should know exactly what to do to get some form of response)
 
5. Finally make the program self executing. (Research how to make the codeexecute/ self running, more or less like theshebang used in designing bash scripts to make it execute)
